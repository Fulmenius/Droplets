# Droplets
Modelling 2D droplets with the Ising model

The file Constants.py contains, it's hard to believe, constants like the constant of spin-to-spin interaction J

The file droplets_test.py contains the main program

The file generators.py contains different initial conditions generators, as well as certain functions related to extracting information about the current configuration of the lattice

The file kawasaki_sample.py contains the Metropolis algorithm adapted to the particular task of modelling droplets
